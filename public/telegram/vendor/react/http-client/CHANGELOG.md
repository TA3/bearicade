# Changelog

## 0.5.6 (2017-09-17)

*   Feature: Update Socket component to support HTTP over Unix domain sockets (UDS)
    (#110 by @clue)

## 0.5.5 (2017-09-10)

## 0.5.4 (2017-08-25)

*   Feature: Update Socket dependency to support hosts file on all platforms
    (#108 by @clue)

    This means that HTTP requests to hosts such as `localhost` will now work as
    expected across all platforms with no changes required:

    ```php
    $client = new Client($loop);
    $request = $client->request('GET', 'http://localhost/');
    $request->on('response', function (Response $response) {
        // â€¦
    });
    $request->end();
    ```

## 0.5.3 (2017-08-16)

*   Feature: Target evenement 3.0 a long side 2.0
    (#106 by @WyriHaximus)

*   Improve test suite by locking Travis distro so new defaults will not break the build
    (#105 by @clue)

## 0.5.2 (2017-06-27)

    (#100 by @clue)

    (#97 by @clue)

## 0.5.0 (2017-05-22)

*   Feature / BC break: Replace `Factory` with simple `Client` constructor
    (#85 by @clue)

    The `Client` now accepts a required `LoopInterface` and an optional
    `ConnectorInterface`. It will now create a default `Connector` if none
    has been given.

    ```php
    // old
    $dnsResolverFactory = new React\Dns\Resolver\Factory();
    $dnsResolver = $dnsResolverFactory->createCached('8.8.8.8', $loop);
    $factory = new React\HttpClient\Factory();
    $client = $factory->create($loop, $dnsResolver);

    // new
    $client = new React\HttpClient\Client($loop);
    ```

*   Feature: `Request::close()` now cancels pending connection attempt
    (#91 by @clue)

*   Feature / BC break: Replace deprecated SocketClient with new Socket component
    (#74, #84 and #88 by @clue)
